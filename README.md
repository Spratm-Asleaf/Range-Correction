# Ranging-Correction

Online complementary materials of the paper titled 

**Denoising, Outlier/Dropout Correction, and Sensor Selection in Range-Based Positioning**

By Shixiong Wang, Zhongming Wu, and Andrew Lim

From the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, National University of Singapore (S. Wang and A. Lim);
and the School of Management Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (Z. Wu).

***Supplementary Materials***

* The file "Supplementary Materials.pdf" contains the materials that help understand the paper, including another example for sensor anomaly in Fig. 2 and possible questions from readers. See contents below.
    ```
    1. Another Example for Sensor Anomaly
    2. If the abnormality (especially continuous anomalies) occurs when the real measurement suddenly changes, 
       can the algorithm cope with it?
    3. What’s the rationale of the model (1)?
    4. What’s the rationale behind the model (12)? The noise process W(n) affects x(n+1) in a correlated way. 
       Why is it reasonable?
    5. Why the authors did not record the time stamps of dropouts and try to recover these locations?
    6. How to obtain (9)?
